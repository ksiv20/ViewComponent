# ViewComponent
This provides an option to select a level and display the score for the selected level.
Also includes a custom rounded start button.
To use this with a logo/image, add the image into the drawable folder and in the activity_main.xml file replace the TextView that contains the temporary text that say [Logo goes here} with an ImageView that contains the desired image.

### Screenshots
Since the easy option is selected, its icon state changes and the accumulated score for this level is displayed.

When another option is chosen, the previously selected icon button is deselected, and the points for the currently selected difficulty level is displayed.
